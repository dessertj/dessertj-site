== Plans for dessert-core 0.5.x

* Utilize information within module-info classes
* Support multi-release jars
* Detect permits of sealed classes as dependencies
* Ready-to-use module definitions for the JDK that resemble the Java17 modules,
  usable for older java versions
* Predicates for filtering by Annotations (for retention types class and runtime)
* More verbose cycle detection error
