== Basics

Dessert is library to detect dependency violations. Hence it detects if there is something
that dependends on something else that it should not. Therefore dessert needs means to
express what's meant be _something_ and _something else_ and _should not depend on_.

Dessert checks dependencies between java classes. A class is represented by `Clazz`.
A `Clazz` stands for anything for which there is a separate .class file (interfaces,
annotation, enums, inner-classes, module specifications and plain classes).

The `Clazz` is the smallest unit of granularity dessert can work with. The biggest
unit is the `Classpath`. The `Classpath` contains all classes within your application.

To specify dependency assertions you have to tear the `Classpath` down into smaller pieces.
Imagine the `Classpath` to be a big cake you have to slice down. Thus the most import concept
of _dessert_ is the `Slice`. The smallest `Slice` is a `Clazz` and the biggest `Slice` is
the `Classpath`.
